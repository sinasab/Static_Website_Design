# Project 4
## Static Web Site Design

## Instructions
To run: Download all the files, navigate to the "project" folder. Then run "bundle install" in the terminal from that directory. Then, run "bundle exec middleman build" in the terminal. Then, run "bundle exec middleman server" in the terminal. Then, open your web browser and navaigate to "localhost:4567". Feast your eyes upon our beautiful web page.

Note: The pages we redesigned were the home page, the media page, and the news page. To find links to the media and news page, ctrl f "media" or "news" from the home page and follow the links. If you load a page and it is scaled to be tiny, reload the page and it should be back to normal.
